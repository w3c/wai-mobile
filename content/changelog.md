This page is designed so translators can copy and paste from this rendered changelog page.

<!-- For others, **particularly significant or substantive changes are summarized after “Significant:”**. -->

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="end" %}
{:/}
{::nomarkdown}
{% include toc.html type="start" title="Page Contents" %}
{:/}

- This will be replaced by an automatically generated TOC when using Markdown formatting.
{::options toc_levels="2,3" /}
{:toc}

{::nomarkdown}
{% include toc.html type="end" %}
{:/}

**_Translators:_**
* Change `last_updated` to the date of the translation update.
* The other dates after `footer >` should match the English version.
* From the GitHub pull request, after a couple of minutes, you can get a preview of your rendered page by selecting the "Details" link after "netlify/wai-.../deploy-preview — Deploy preview ready!". Then select your language at the top.
